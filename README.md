# <Challenge-one>

## Description

This is the first assignment for which modifications were applied to existing code. The goal of these modifications were to make HTML more accessible (i.e. screen readers); while replacing the non-seamantic elements. Additional changes made to Stylesheet to possibly make it less crowded in addition to maintaining the apearance and functionality. One link in the header which was not functional also got fixed to assure user can navigate to intended section.
